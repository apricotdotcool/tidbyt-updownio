# updown.io for Tidbyt

[updown.io](https://updown.io) checks your website's status by periodically sending an HTTP request to the URL of your choice and notifies you when your website is not responding correctly. [Tidbyt](https://tidbyt.com) is a retro-style display that lets you keep up with the things you care about, like real time sports, transit, finance and more.

How'd you like to have your updown.io checks on your Tidbyt?

Done.
